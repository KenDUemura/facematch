facematch
=========
Made this Android Face Matching App for School Project. It uses camera to detects the human face, sends face picture to the server and returns best matching face from list of face pictures.

Disclaimer

* I've only tested to work with Nexus 10. It kept crashing with Nexus 4 and other devices.
* There are some hard coded server urls in the code.
* This is just an example.
